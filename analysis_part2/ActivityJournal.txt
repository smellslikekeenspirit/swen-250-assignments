Implement these functions in the order below.

Your name: Prionti Nasir

================================================================
process_word
Start 
Estimated Time	07 00
Plan: - Read the doc before starting 
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use 
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	10 00
Observations: - This mainly took a lot of time because I was stressing over why MLK excerpt 
              tests were giving errors for clear_linked_list. I rewrote it a lot of times
              - Now for this function, I was getting 0 instead of 1 when the test passed in
              an empty list. I had to stop using find_word's result and write a separate
              test for p_list->p_head == NULL. I then added a new_node. 
              I learned to be consistent and keep in mind all cases of  all the functions related
              to the developing code.

================================================================
get_first_word
Start 
Estimated Time	10 10
Plan: - Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors

(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	10 25
Observations:   This was easy because there was not much to figure out
                except for following the instructions and using pointers
                correctly.

================================================================
get_next_word
Start
Estimated Time	10 30
Plan: - Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors

(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	11 03
Observations: I was getting test 20 and 21 wrong repeatedly. After trying to debug 
              this function for a long time I realized I had to update the current 
              pointer in both this function and the get first word function.

================================================================
get_last_word
Start
Estimated Time	11 15
Plan  - Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete       
Actual Time	11 30
Observations: This was done by following the instructions and running
              the resultant code.

================================================================
get_prev_word
Start
Estimated Time	11 32
Plan: - Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	11 39
Observations: This also was pretty straight-forward. I was confused about whether
              the current should point to the previous or the next but it worked 
              out fine when I used previous.

================================================================
read_file through test 56
Start
Estimated Time	11 39
Plan: - Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	12 26
Observations: For this I had to look up how to handle file creation
and manipulation. I also used isalpha which helped a lot and saved
extra tests.

================================================================
read_file MLK_dream_excerpt only
Start
Estimated Time	12 30
Plan: - Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors

(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	12 35
Observations: I just had to brush up on the older code.

================================================================
write_unique_word_list_to_csv_file
Start
Estimated Time	12 38
Plan:- Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	12 55
Observations: I needed to look up file-writing in C. And I got an error 
of invalid initializer which I could immediately detect came from doing
FILE file instead of FILE *file.

================================================================
Add four unit tests to the unit_tests_student.c file
Start
Estimated Time	1 00
Plan: - Read the doc before starting
      - Be consistent with linked_list_functions and remember to use
        it in further code
      - Write code following the step-by-step doc given
      - Compile and fix errors
      - Debug further errors

(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	1 33
Observations: I took time to learn how to write tests.
And I had to think of what functions to use.
