Database -- SQL Practice - Relational Joins

Name: Prionti Nasir

================================================================
Queries 1 through 10:
Estimated Time	02 00
Plan: -Look up sql joins 
      -Implement in your queries
      -Debug
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	03 00
Observations: It was mostly smooth except that I did it all without
joins and then had to redo it with join because I wanted to learn
to use it. I noticed that if I did:
SELECT Player.name, Player.number, Player.team 

FROM Player, Coach 

INNER JOIN Coach ON Player.team = Coach.team 

WHERE Player.position BETWEEN 7 AND 9 AND Coach.title = "Manager"  

AND Coach.name LIKE "John%";

I got an ambiguous column error. Is it because two instances or something
for Coach table are created? This was solved by simply removing
Coach from the FROM line.

================================================================
Queries 11 through 15 (extra credit if done):
Estimated Time  01 00
Plan: -Look up the functions in the hints and subqueries
      -Implement
      -Debug
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	01 30
Observations: I took a lot of time to learn to use subqueries
and to use "nested" SELECT or FROM statements because SQL seems
kind of different from usual programming languages, but I eventually
figured it out.
